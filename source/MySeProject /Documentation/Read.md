#  ML 23/24-10 Multi-Sequence Learning with language semantic.

Multi-sequence learning refers to a type of machine learning or artificial intelligence approach where the model is trained on multiple sequences of data.
In the context of language semantics, multi-sequence learning can be applied to tasks that involve understanding the meaning and relationships  between multiple sequences of words, sentences, or paragraphs. 

Multi-sequence learning can be implemented using a variety of different algorithms. However, all of these algorithms share some common principles. First, they all need to be able to represent multiple sequences of data. Second, they all need to be able to learn the relationships between the sequences. Finally, they all need to be able to generate new sequences of data that are similar to the training data.
